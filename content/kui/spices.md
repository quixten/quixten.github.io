Spice mixes of my own I have tested and the results of those tests:

### Spicy-Sharp Alchemy Powder

- Cajun Spice Mix,	3部
- 七味唐辛子,	6部
- 고춧가루,	1部
- Garlic Powder, 1部
- 出汁パウダー,	1部

A sharp, spicy mix that is, because of its high ratio of 七味唐辛子, quite adjacent to that, but spicier and more rounded. Excellent as a blackening spice for chicken.
