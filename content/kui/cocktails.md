Mixed drinks, all of which I call "cocktails", without regard for the number of ingredients or the complexity of the flavor profile, are an important aspect of my drinking habits. Most drinking days will have me throwing back whiskey & coke because it's easy and tasty and cheap, and if that isn't a cocktail in your book, that's fine with me.

On this page I'll list some cocktail specs I like, and maybe some I've invented. For most things I go by weight and mix on a digital scale.

### Highball, my spec

A highball is the simplest possible cocktail, composed of a spirit and a mixer. The spirit is usually but not always the American standard 80 proof base of vodka, whiskey, gin, rum, &c, and the mixer is usually but not always a carbonated drink, usually but not always plain soda. For me, the standard quantities are:

- A spirit, 90 g
- A mixer, 180 g

The procedure is: in a glass on the rocks, mix thoroughly.

Some common highballs in my life are Whiskey (bourbon or rye) and Coke (cane sugar or HFCS), Gin and Tonic, Screwdrivers (vodka and orange juice), Mules (a spirit, often vodka or rum and ginger beer), and any syrup with vodka and soda.

### Margarita

A Margarita is a strong cocktail made of 3 to 5 parts spirit to 1 part lime juice. It is integral to use fresh juice.

Because limes vary in the amount of juice they yield, if you want to risk no waste, it is best to first measure your yield from one lime. If you don't get enough juice, use another. Double and triple that number and use that much Cointreau and Tequila respectively.

- Lime juice, 1 part
- Cointreau, 2 parts
- Tequila, silver, 3 parts
