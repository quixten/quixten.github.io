The basic procedure for creating a quesadilla is as follows:

1. Have a large tortilla, shredded cheese of a reasonably meltable variety, add-ins, and sauces ready.

2. Place tortilla on a hot cooking surface. A large, nonstick flat bottom pan or wok works well. Whatever you use, you should be able to cover the food to trap steam for best results. Heat should be medium or medium-low. If browning of tortilla fails to happen fast enough, adjust upward. If it happens to fast, adjust downward.

3. Scatter your protein on the far half of the tortilla.

4. Scatter your cheese over the whole tortilla.

5. Drizzle your sauce over the far half of the tortilla.

6. Cover the quesadilla briefly until the cheese has adequately melted and you can easily fold it in half.

7. Flip until you have achieved the desired level of browning.

8. Use a spatula to cut the quesadilla in half. Plate and serve.
