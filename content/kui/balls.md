Meatballs are an excellent option for meal prep, because they store wonderfully in easy-to-use portions, are versatile and delicious and an economical protein.

You can make meatballs with any ground meat, but I prefer lamb for its flavor. You'll also want a filler to bulk up the quantity and provide tenderness, and the filler I opt for is tofu for its convenience, but bread crumbs are traditional. Whatever you use, avoid overdoing the filler.

I like Black Pepper, Salt, Garlic Powder, Parsley, and some strong herb or spice for flavor. Chinese vendors will have seasoning blends variously formulated but all named something like "Pepper Salt", which are generally Black Pepper, Salt, and a small number of spices, which works great.

Combine the non-meat ingredients in a bowl and mix, thoroughly breaking up the tofu before mixing into the meat. Form into small balls and bake on a tray at 375 for roughly a half-hour. The balls should be browned well. Store in appropriate containers in the fridge or freezer.

Ingredients:

1. Ground beef/pork/lamb, 32 oz
2. Tofu, any firmness, 12-16 oz
3. Pepper Salt, to taste
4. Garlic Powder, to taste
5. Parsley, 1 bunch, finely chopped
