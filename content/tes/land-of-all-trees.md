#### Chorus:
Home of mine, thou storied hall,  
No country boasts green trees so tall,  
From greatest spruce, to shrub most mean,  
Thou show'st me ever greener green,  
Though long my tooth may ere I go,  
All thy sights, I'll never know,  
Oh carpets soft, and dewdrink good,  
My land of all trees, Valenwood.  

#### Verse (Birch):
With bark of alabaster white,  
Your branches reach with meagre might,  
A trusty trunk, a wholesome shade,  
Birch, the forest's collonnade.
