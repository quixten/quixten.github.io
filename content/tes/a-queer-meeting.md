For a lover of long, rambling walks, the enormous complex of tunnels and outposts the Dwemer carved into the Southern mountain ranges of Skyrim are the perfect retreat, and having a base in Athamez gives Hjolfr unparalleled access. For all he's explored though, he mayn't have ever been this far East in them. He reckons that he might have made it all the way out to the Jeralls South of the Rift.

The tunnels out here are sparse, with only a pit stop every few miles for resting and perhaps delving. They're somewhat unwelcoming, since they were designed more for automata than beings of flesh, but they are tolerable. A faint colored light shines from the ceiling exactly every quarter of a Dwemer mile, certainly not bright enough to see by, and each slightly different in hue and brightness, meant as they are to encode locational information for the scanning of centurions.

At some point, Hjolfr encounters a town of sorts. There's a recognizable market and housing and on the other end are tunnels more suitable for non-metal beings to transit. But before he can decide whether to camp out here, he encounters something else. Great soft white scales like velvet alabaster, the coat of a magnificent serpent is the first thing of interest he's seen in a hundred leagues.

"When you leave here, tell no one of me, please", [snek name] pleads.

"Why?", Hjolfr presses, curious.

"I am but an old thing, from far away and many centuries past, but I am aware of the way tales grow across tellings. I wish not to disturb the dreams of children."
