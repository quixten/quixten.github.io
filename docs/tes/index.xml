      <description>Chorus: Home of mine, thou storied hall,&#xA;No country boasts green trees so tall,&#xA;From greatest spruce, to shrub most mean,&#xA;Thou show&amp;rsquo;st me ever greener green,&#xA;Though long my tooth may ere I go,&#xA;All thy sights, I&amp;rsquo;ll never know,&#xA;Oh carpets soft, and dewdrink good,&#xA;My land of all trees, Valenwood.&#xA;Verse (Birch): With bark of alabaster white,&#xA;Your branches reach with meagre might,&#xA;A trusty trunk, a wholesome shade,</description>

      <description>For a lover of long, rambling walks, the enormous complex of tunnels and outposts the Dwemer carved into the Southern mountain ranges of Skyrim are the perfect retreat, and having a base in Athamez gives Hjolfr unparalleled access. For all he&amp;rsquo;s explored though, he mayn&amp;rsquo;t have ever been this far East in them. He reckons that he might have made it all the way out to the Jeralls South of the Rift.</description>

      <description>Wood is too pliant. With every strike accompanied by a simultaneous clink and a defeated clunk, Seraphina pounds out the bigger notches in the blade of her sword on the unsatisfactory anvil of an old crate in her apartment. The jaw of a simple forest wolf should not be so doughty.&#xA;Her knees aching from the walk, Sera cursed her neglect in her training. Just about as she surfaced into some idyllic pool clearing where she was already entertaining thoughts of relaxing and recuperating, a not-entirely familiar grumble alerted her to an ambush of local carnivores.</description>

      <description>A letter written by Hjolfr of the Reach to himself&#xA;Curious branch of study, logomancy. Strictly speaking, it&amp;rsquo;s the study of the magic of &amp;lsquo;words&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;words&amp;rsquo; here meaning any sound that bears meaning to creatures capable of thought. It is hotly debated whether Thu&amp;rsquo;um is a form of logomancy, or whether it is a form of Tonal Architecture, by the kind of imbeciles that think it must only be a form of one with no aspects of the other, and by the kind of ignoramuses that fail to grasp that the two supercategories whose basics they pretend to grasp are not as separate as they think.</description>
