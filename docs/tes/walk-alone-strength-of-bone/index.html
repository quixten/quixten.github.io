        <p>Wood is too pliant. With every strike accompanied by a simultaneous clink and a defeated clunk, Seraphina pounds out the bigger notches in the blade of her sword on the unsatisfactory anvil of an old crate in her apartment. The jaw of a simple forest wolf should not be so doughty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her knees aching from the walk, Sera cursed her neglect in her training. Just about as she surfaced into some idyllic pool clearing where she was already entertaining thoughts of relaxing and recuperating, a not-entirely familiar grumble alerted her to an ambush of local carnivores. There were three of them. Grey as the stone of Fort Alessia, fur matted and filthy, they stirred from their daze near the pool and sized her up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dozens of them. Dozens of scars on the bladesedge, most of which will be impossible to mend without resort to a blacksmith&rsquo;s fire, and the stipend of a dormant Imperial soldier won&rsquo;t cover that and leave her yet able to put bread on her table. Frustrated, Sera knocks at the edge, slowly working straight the bent and split edges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A wolf had gone down, and she&rsquo;d fortunately taken no wounds. But her knees still hurt, and the two remaining looked fierce. Angry. But no less starved. She caught the second with a lucky cut to its back as it lunged, and she avoided being pinned by its claws. It was barely deterred, and as the beast snapped back at her with its teeth, she kicked it in the face, panting with exertion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As she finishes the rough work and admires the pathetically battered weapon, she tosses her hammer on the nearby table and fishes around the clutter for her worn plyers, intent on making this blasted hunk of metal last her a while longer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The two wolves, one bleeding comically, the other unhurt and clever-looking, circled Sera, who wasn&rsquo;t able to keep them both in front of her. Testing her perforated leg from where she suffered a light bite, she feigned a stumble, leading the wounded and angrier wolf to pounce past her as she ducked to the side. She&rsquo;d regained view of both of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to bend the cool and somewhat brittle iron aright, and Sera takes her sweet time at it. The last thing she needs is to hastily attempt a bend the material can&rsquo;t take and have a big chip come off the edge. Slow and steady, testing the material&rsquo;s strength as she goes, she painstakingly keeps working.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally a terrifying moment came where she genuinely did stumble. The dizziness took her for the barest of moments before she came to and saw both ravening wolves loping fast towards her, their teeth bared. With a last, panicked motion, she swiped a horizontal cut that sliced past the neck of one before crunching into the jaw of the other. Both were clearly mortal wounds, but she killed them rightly to make sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crisp sea air of the early evening filtering into her apartment, she beholds the shining iron, still a sorry sight, but her companion of many years nonetheless, and adores its gleam in the light of the setting sun. As the darkness deepens, she wonders if she could find that pool again and rest her aching joints in its waters.</p>
