        <p><em>A letter written by Hjolfr of the Reach to himself</em></p>
<p>Curious branch of study, logomancy. Strictly speaking, it&rsquo;s the study of the magic of &lsquo;words&rsquo;, &lsquo;words&rsquo; here meaning any sound that bears meaning to creatures capable of thought. It is hotly debated whether Thu&rsquo;um is a form of logomancy, or whether it is a form of Tonal Architecture, by the kind of imbeciles that think it must only be a form of one with no aspects of the other, and by the kind of ignoramuses that fail to grasp that the two supercategories whose basics they pretend to grasp are not as separate as they think. No, the Thu&rsquo;um is ruled nearly as inexorably by the pure, belting, bellowing Tones of its practitioners as it is by the Meanings the ancient words of the Dragons carry, and the Tones of my original specialty are fairly <em>laced</em> with socially and epigenetically constructed meaning, in much the same way that the color of a set of curtains is.</p>
<p>But of course in practice neither of these fields are considered by the standard scholar of logomancy to be members of it, because the standard scholar of logomancy is too in love with the esoteric to spare a thought for such pedestrian arts. No, the type species of the set of fields that comprise logomancy is the study of the protonymic. That pseudomythical Name-word which all things have tucked away at the very bottom of their souls, but which few know, or even know of. Of course, scholars of logomancy are only very slightly more likely than the average person to know the protonymic of anything, let alone anything useful or beautiful. Nor do they tend to truly grasp what it is they study. Less &lsquo;scholars&rsquo;, and more &lsquo;collectors&rsquo;, I deem. Philonymists. Logomancy is so much more.</p>
<p>Certainly a protonymic is a grand mystery. I have heard wonderful stories, such as how the renowned green Glass of Morrowind came to be because, in his ever-tortured contemplations within his immotile Heart within the chamber of Kagrenac, in a fit of futile but ever-relatable longing for freedom, Lorkhan&rsquo;s half-dead mind siezed upon the protonymic of the volcanic silica around him and quite literally boiled all of the Glass under Red Mountain into existence. Nonsense, perhaps. What is definitely not nonsense is the nature of the strivings of that Kagrenac who, beating and cutting at the invincible flesh of Lorkhan&rsquo;s heart, miraculously harnessed those selfsame yearnings to throw off all shackles, and so his Tones did set him and his race free from all the mortal coil.</p>
<p>That is some low-level stuff though. Forgive me, I do not mean unskilled. These &lsquo;protonymics&rsquo;, and the subtle workings of Tonal Architecture, even the terrifyingly potent effects of the well-honed Thu&rsquo;um, they all work on very basal structures. They are &rsquo;low-concept&rsquo;, as the storytellers say. I think. What I mean to say is that logomancy is so much more, just as capable of the simple, the artificial, and the functional. The Utilisphere, so named for its utility, is series of logomantic enchantment layers on top of a core Tonal logic stratum. Still very low-level, very muchado to do a moderate amount of work, but it&rsquo;s a very large leap from what Kagrenac and his fellows were capable of. Oh yes, though the Dwemer invented the things, the living mages of the Arcane University, and yes, I, improved drastically upon them. We still fail to grasp some of the most fundamental concepts that they were so very learned in, but when you build high-level on low-level in logomancy it doesn&rsquo;t turn out to be a very large hindrance.</p>

Scribe this into a utilisphere with a functioning interpretation layer of my design in version seventy, and the stupidest troll could find themselves with a short commute from Leyawiin to Markarth. Not that I&rsquo;d give a troll access to my work, no matter how staunch an advocate for freedom of information I am.</p>
<p>In any case, such a thing is a central example of logomancy. Far from eclectic mystery or eldritch power, it&rsquo;s capable of extremely purpose-oriented work if you harness it with the right scaffolding, and with enough setup, and some tweaking and some design refinements, I&rsquo;ll maybe realize something I need it for&hellip;</p>
