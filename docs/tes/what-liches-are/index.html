      <div class="post-content">
        <p>The greatest of all prey for a witchhunter, a knight, an inquisitor, or any of the other ways one might align their fates in the correction of great evils, is the lich; a lich being nothing more or less than a person whose mortality is deferred by the creation of a phylactery, a vessel which they, through a great working of physic and magic, impregnate with their soul, freshly amputated from their living body, granting them unending unlife until such time as their phylactery is broke open or their magical working is through strange circumstance unraveled.</p>
<p>I will not provide you, the reader, such a recipe as would enable you to easily duplicate the process, but where most of the rare descriptions omit the moral cost, as if that were the most arcane and esoteric aspect, I will make it plain, the better to arouse your sensibilities before fixation and obsession robs you of them. It is a cost beyond your most depraved imaginings.</p>
<p>To make a phylactery one must first prepare the vessel and the ritual. Poisoned chalk must draw poison sigils on poisoned stone. Poisoned candles and poisoned incense must perfume the air. Geometric perfection must be achieved in poisoned glass, an octahedron of four fingers in length, placed at the magical barycenter of the inscribed phrases in the circle.</p>
<p>The caster must invest the vessel with their name, and then go about the world, erasing every other instance of it in record of any kind. Documents must be redacted or destroyed, memories must be modified or the minds that hold them destroyed. At this stage the only remaining recordings of the caster&rsquo;s name are in the phylactery, and in the caster&rsquo;s mind itself.</p>
<p>That name must then be given in trust to a charge. That charge must come to rely entirely on the caster for their security and well-being. The caster must vow, with word and with magic, to defend the charge even unto death. It must be that the charge believes with the full weight of their soul that the caster will protect them, up to and including at the moment of their death. The caster must bring them into the ritual chamber, amidst the poison fumes and assured of their safety, and then they must kill them. The inversion of avowed moral duty, transgressing it on an innocent to the utmost degree, is what disfigures the soul so that it can slip the bonds of the caster&rsquo;s mortal bones and be trapped in inert geometry.</p>
<p>Further, once the charge is dead, the caster must swiftly and immediately remove their own memory of their name, so that their mutilated soul cannot find its way back or elsewhere, the only remaining referent to who the caster was being trapped within the phylactery with it.</p>
<p>This process is why liches are viewed by many to be an ultimate evil. Not for what they go on to do, though the possibilities for further evil are endless, but because of what they had to do in the first place. A lich represents an enduring moral atrocity in the world, one which cannot be suffered to exist by even the most worldly of moral thinkers, no matter what they do with their unlife after. May all who read this pray with me for the success of those brave enough to right such wrongs.</p>
