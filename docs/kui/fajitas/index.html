        <p>Fajitas are a Tex-Mex food composed largely of protein and veggies, cut into strips and cooked together. The standard ingredients are skirt steak (diaphragm), onion, and chili pepper. The standard way to eat them is rolled in a tortilla with or without condiments.</p>
<p>Fajitas are an effective way to produce a substantial amount of tasty bulk to eat over the course of a week. They can be refrigerated and used in a variety of ways. Each ingredient leaches out some flavor into the other ingredients while retaining distinctness, producing an end result that is more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p><img alt="An examplejita" src="/img/kui/fajitas.png"></p>
<p>To make fajitas, I buy about 1.5 lbs of a cheap cut of meat, preferably a savory land mammal, 3 lbs of white or yellow onions, and 2 lbs of capsicum, generally a mild fleshy chili such as Poblano for bulk and a spicy small chili such as Serrano for heat.</p>
<p>To prepare, cut the veggies into strips, but not the meat, and keep them separate. I like cutting my hot chilis into rings. Also keep some clean water available in a cup or bowl.</p>
<p>After heating a wide-bottomed pan or dutch oven with some oil, sear the meat thoroughly to produce browning and a good fond (be careful that it does not burn). After all of the meat is so seared, rest it while you cook the onions.</p>
<p>After adding salt and while stirring the onions, attempt to scrape the fond off the pan and mix it with the onion. If it does not seem to be producing enough liquid, or if the fond is at risk of burning, using some of your clean water to deglaze is fine. Use little enough that it will evaporate by the time you are finished.</p>
<p>Once the onion is softened somewhat, add the chili peppers, along with any spices, though I would advise against using too many or too much of them. I like paprika, cumin, and a savoriness enhancer such as mushroom powder or MSG. At this point you have let the meat rest for long enough, and you should cut it into strips against the grain. The irregularly shaped ends make a nice treat for the cook.</p>
<p>After mixing the strips of meat into the dish, once they are fully cooked and the veggies are soft enough for your liking, you are done.</p>
