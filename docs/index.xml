      <description>&lt;p&gt;The greatest of all prey for a witchhunter, a knight, an inquisitor, or any of the other ways one might align their fates in the correction of great evils, is the lich; a lich being nothing more or less than a person whose mortality is deferred by the creation of a phylactery, a vessel which they, through a great working of physic and magic, impregnate with their soul, freshly amputated from their living body, granting them unending unlife until such time as their phylactery is broke open or their magical working is through strange circumstance unraveled.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cocktails</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mixed drinks, all of which I call &amp;ldquo;cocktails&amp;rdquo;, without regard for the number of ingredients or the complexity of the flavor profile, are an important aspect of my drinking habits. Most drinking days will have me throwing back whiskey &amp;amp; coke because it&amp;rsquo;s easy and tasty and cheap, and if that isn&amp;rsquo;t a cocktail in your book, that&amp;rsquo;s fine with me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On this page I&amp;rsquo;ll list some cocktail specs I like, and maybe some I&amp;rsquo;ve invented. For most things I go by weight and mix on a digital scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fajitas</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fajitas are a Tex-Mex food composed largely of protein and veggies, cut into strips and cooked together. The standard ingredients are skirt steak (diaphragm), onion, and chili pepper. The standard way to eat them is rolled in a tortilla with or without condiments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fajitas are an effective way to produce a substantial amount of tasty bulk to eat over the course of a week. They can be refrigerated and used in a variety of ways. Each ingredient leaches out some flavor into the other ingredients while retaining distinctness, producing an end result that is more than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quesadillas</title>
      <link>https://quixten.github.io/kui/dillas/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The basic procedure for creating a quesadilla is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have a large tortilla, shredded cheese of a reasonably meltable variety, add-ins, and sauces ready.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Place tortilla on a hot cooking surface. A large, nonstick flat bottom pan or wok works well. Whatever you use, you should be able to cover the food to trap steam for best results. Heat should be medium or medium-low. If browning of tortilla fails to happen fast enough, adjust upward. If it happens to fast, adjust downward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a lover of long, rambling walks, the enormous complex of tunnels and outposts the Dwemer carved into the Southern mountain ranges of Skyrim are the perfect retreat, and having a base in Athamez gives Hjolfr unparalleled access. For all he&amp;rsquo;s explored though, he mayn&amp;rsquo;t have ever been this far East in them. He reckons that he might have made it all the way out to the Jeralls South of the Rift.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spice mixes of my own I have tested and the results of those tests:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;spicy-sharp-alchemy-powder&#34;&gt;Spicy-Sharp Alchemy Powder&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cajun Spice Mix,&#x9;3部&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;七味唐辛子,&#x9;6部&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;고춧가루,&#x9;1部&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Garlic Powder, 1部&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;出汁パウダー,&#x9;1部&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A sharp, spicy mix that is, because of its high ratio of 七味唐辛子, quite adjacent to that, but spicier and more rounded. Excellent as a blackening spice for chicken.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Walk Alone, Strength of Bone</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wood is too pliant. With every strike accompanied by a simultaneous clink and a defeated clunk, Seraphina pounds out the bigger notches in the blade of her sword on the unsatisfactory anvil of an old crate in her apartment. The jaw of a simple forest wolf should not be so doughty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her knees aching from the walk, Sera cursed her neglect in her training. Just about as she surfaced into some idyllic pool clearing where she was already entertaining thoughts of relaxing and recuperating, a not-entirely familiar grumble alerted her to an ambush of local carnivores. There were three of them. Grey as the stone of Fort Alessia, fur matted and filthy, they stirred from their daze near the pool and sized her up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Mancies, New Fancies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A letter written by Hjolfr of the Reach to himself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Curious branch of study, logomancy. Strictly speaking, it&amp;rsquo;s the study of the magic of &amp;lsquo;words&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;words&amp;rsquo; here meaning any sound that bears meaning to creatures capable of thought. It is hotly debated whether Thu&amp;rsquo;um is a form of logomancy, or whether it is a form of Tonal Architecture, by the kind of imbeciles that think it must only be a form of one with no aspects of the other, and by the kind of ignoramuses that fail to grasp that the two supercategories whose basics they pretend to grasp are not as separate as they think. No, the Thu&amp;rsquo;um is ruled nearly as inexorably by the pure, belting, bellowing Tones of its practitioners as it is by the Meanings the ancient words of the Dragons carry, and the Tones of my original specialty are fairly &lt;em&gt;laced&lt;/em&gt; with socially and epigenetically constructed meaning, in much the same way that the color of a set of curtains is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
